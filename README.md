# "J'ai mal à la tête."

## Motivation:
The beginning of a long-awaited overhaul of my dev environment, whose present state was my first time employing a construct for backing up my configs 'n such. 

It wasn't a very good one. I found myself constantly wrestling with my keyboard, unknowingly having broken a component resulting from an arcane detail buried in minutia, planted firmly on some razor's edge case. 

This is an overdue attempt to uphold my end of a constant promising to myself that I'd find (and dedicate) the time to "do it right."

Ah, yes, the naivete of a young software engineer... 

## Goals:
* Adhere to XDG standards (within reason, lots of software doesn't bother)
* Achieve a turn-key setup procedure (lofty ambition)
* Predict/strategize/adapt to whichever architecture awaits me on the next PC I setup (strongly considering Ansible, if prudent)

## Technologies: 
*These are either currently implemented or slated-to-be. Plenty of innate elements of experimentation.*
* chezmoi for dotfiles
* GNU Stow for managing software builds
* Bash/Zsh
* neovim
* tmux

## **WIP**
*obviously...*

No promises on the *doing it right* part. The only promise I'll make is to learn something along the way.
